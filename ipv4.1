NOTES
.RS 2
Many operating systems rewrite some or all of the IP header when sending
packets.  Exactly which headers get rewritten depends on the OS.  There is
no portable way to bypass this that the author is aware of. So some IP options
do not work on some operating systems.  Below is a list with known limitations.
This list is not by any means complete and what is here may not be accurate.
If you have more information, please contact the author of this software or
your OS vendor.
\" Common problems
.HP 2
\- IP source address is rewritten if it is zero.
.HP
\- IP packet ID is rewritten (to a randomish value) if it is zero.
.HP
\- IP checksum is always rewritten to the correct value.
.HP
\- Total packet length is always rewritten to the number of bytes sent.
\" Solaris start
.HP
\- IP header length works provided that the length given is not greater
than the number of bytes in the packet.  If it is, sendip will segfault.
.HP
\- IP don't fragment flag always set, other IP flags always cleared.
\" Solaris end
.HP
\- All other headers work as expected.
