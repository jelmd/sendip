# SendIP
A CLI tool to send arbitrary IP packets.

## Features

SendIP has a large number of command line options to specify the content of every header of a NTP, BGP, RIP, RIPng, TCP, UDP, ICMP or raw IPv4 and IPv6 packet. It also allows any data to be added to the packet.

## Notes

This repo is a fork of **Mike Rickett**'s [SendIP 2.5, 29/07/2003](http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/sendip.html). It's main purpose is to collect and apply patches/improvements found in the wild and make it available to the world.
