# SendIP
A CLI tool to send arbitrary IP packets.

## Features

SendIP has a large number of command line options to specify the content of
every header of a NTP, BGP, RIP, RIPng, TCP, UDP, ICMP or raw IPv4 and IPv6
packet. It also allows any data to be added to the packet.

## Notes

This repo is a fork of **Mike Ricketts**'
[SendIP 2.5, 29/07/2003](http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/sendip.html)
and contains major enhancements implemented by Mark Carson which can also be
found via the [NIST SendIP](https://www-x.antd.nist.gov/ipv6/sendip.html) web
page as well as many other contributors.

The repo's main purpose is actually to collect and apply patches/improvements
found in the wild and make it available to the world.
