# SendIP

Sendip is command line tool to send arbitrary IP packets. It has a large number
of command line options to specify the content of every header of a NTP, BGP,
RIP, RIPng, TCP, UDP, ICMP, or raw IPv4 or IPv6 packet.  It also allows any 
data to be added to the packet.

## Notes

This repo is a fork of **Mike Ricketts**'
[SendIP 2.5, 29/07/2003](http://www.earth.li/projectpurple/progs/sendip.html)
(now also available via [Github](https://github.com/rickettm/SendIP))
and contains major enhancements implemented by Mark Carson which in turn can be
found via the [NIST SendIP](https://www-x.antd.nist.gov/ipv6/sendip.html) web
page as well as many other contributors.

For now repo's main purpose is actually to collect and apply
patches/improvements found in the wild and make it available to the world.

If you need some new features (or bug fixes), please feel free to create an
issue via https://github.com/jelmd/sendip/issues .
